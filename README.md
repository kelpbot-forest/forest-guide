# Welcome to Kelp Forest!

Kelp Forest is a place for the Kelp user community to collaborate, share their Kelp-related projects, and support one another's development efforts. An ecosystem, as it were. We invite you to join us, and hope you can find what you're looking for here.

### What is Kelp?

[Kelp](https://github.com/interstellar/kelp) is an open-source trading bot for the [Stellar network's](https://www.stellar.org/) decentralized exchange, developed by [Interstellar](https://interstellar.com/). It is a command-line application, with the capacity for customized trading strategies. 

### Why does the Forest exist?

Kelp does not have integrated customization functionality. Instead, users can program their strategies (or other custom functionality) into the source code itself and compile custom Kelp builds. Coding your own components for Kelp is challenging, especially if you don't have a ton of experience with the Go programming language. This was the seed for the Forest. 

If we share what we learn while creating our projects we can help the Kelp ecosystem thrive, with diverse custom components and other projects. We also hope to foster a collaborative and supportive environment for the Kelp user community as a whole.

### What can I find in the Forest?

- Here in the forest guide you can find information on participating in our community and high-level resources for Kelp development. This repository is also the place to volunteer to join us as a Forest member, ask questions about the Forest, and propose new Forest projects.
- The [Strategy Compendium](https://github.com/kelpbot-forest/kelp-strategies), a repository of deployment ready custom strategies. 
- [Rockfish](https://github.com/kelpbot-forest/rockfish), a community variant of Kelp with additional features, including Compendium strategies.
